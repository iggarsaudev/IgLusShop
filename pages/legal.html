            <li>
              Principle of lawfulness, fairness, and transparency: The User's

              responsible for ensuring compliance with the above principles.
            </li>
          </ul>

          <h4 class="legal__info-subtitle">Categories of Personal Data</h4>
          <p>
            The categories of data processed by

          <p>
            The User will have the right to withdraw their consent at any time.
            Withdrawing consent will be as easy as giving it. As a general rule,
            withdrawing consent will not condition the use of the Website.
          </p>
          <p>
            In cases where the User must or can provide their data through forms
            to make inquiries, request information, or for reasons related to
            the content of the Website, they will be informed if completing any

          <h4 class="legal__info-subtitle">Personal Data of Minors</h4>
          <p>
            In compliance with the provisions of Articles 8 of the GDPR and 7 of
            Organic Law 3/2018, of December 5, on Personal Data Protection and
            Guarantee of Digital Rights, only individuals over the age of 14 may
            lawfully give their consent for the processing of their personal
            data by
            <span class="highlight">IgLu's Shop</span>. If the individual is

            for the processing, and it will only be considered lawful to the
            extent that they have authorized it.

            unauthorized disclosure or access to such data.

          <p>
            The Website has an SSL (Secure Socket Layer) certificate, which

            undue delay when a personal data security breach occurs that is
            likely to result in a high risk to the rights and freedoms of
            natural persons. In accordance with Article 4 of the GDPR, a
            personal data security breach is understood as any security breach
            that results in accidental or unlawful destruction, loss,
            alteration, unauthorized disclosure of, or access to personal data

            Rights Derived from the Processing of Personal Data

          <p>
            The User has the following rights regarding
            <span class="highlight">IgLu's Shop</span> and may therefore
            exercise them against the Data Controller as recognized under the
            GDPR and Organic Law 3/2018, of December 5, on Personal Data
            Protection and Guarantee of Digital Rights:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              <i>Right of access:</i> This is the User's right to obtain
              confirmation of whether
              <span class="highlight">IgLu's Shop</span> is processing their
              personal data and, if so, to obtain information about their
              specific personal data and the processing that
              <span class="highlight">IgLu's Shop</span> has carried out or is
              carrying out. This includes, among other things, information about
              the origin of such data and the recipients of any communications
              made or planned.
            </li>
            <li>
              <i>Right to rectification:</i> This is the User's right to have
              their inaccurate personal data corrected or, considering the
              purposes of the processing, completed if incomplete.
            </li>
            <li>
              <i>Right to erasure ("right to be forgotten"):</i> This is the
              User's right, provided current legislation does not establish
              otherwise, to have their personal data erased when it is no longer
              necessary for the purposes for which it was collected or
              processed; when the User withdraws their consent and there is no
              other legal basis for processing; when the User objects to
              processing and there are no other legitimate reasons to continue;
              when personal data has been unlawfully processed; when personal
              data must be erased in compliance with a legal obligation; or when
              personal data has been obtained as a result of a direct offer of
              information society services to a child under 14 years old. In
              addition to erasing the data, the Data Controller must take
              reasonable steps, considering available technology and
              implementation costs, to inform other controllers processing the
              personal data of the data subject's request for erasure of any
              links to such personal data.

              <i>Right to restrict processing:</i> This is the User's right to
              restrict the processing of their personal data. The User has this
              right when they contest the accuracy of their personal data; when
              processing is unlawful; when the Data Controller no longer needs
              the personal data but the User requires it for legal claims; or
              when the User has objected to processing.
            </li>
            <li>
              <i>Right to data portability:</i> If processing is carried out by
              automated means, the User has the right to receive their personal
              data from the Data Controller in a structured, commonly used, and
              machine-readable format and to transmit it to another controller.
              Where technically possible, the Data Controller will directly
              transmit the data to that other controller.
