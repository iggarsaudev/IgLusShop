          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              Principle of lawfulness, fairness, and transparency: The User's

            <li>
              Principle of integrity and confidentiality: Personal data will be

              responsible for ensuring compliance with the above principles.
            </li>
          </ul>

          <h4 class="legal__info-subtitle">Categories of Personal Data</h4>
          <p>
            The categories of data processed by
            <span class="highlight">IgLu's Shop</span> are solely identifying
            data. Under no circumstances are special categories of personal
            data, as defined in Article 9 of the GDPR, processed.

          <p>
            The categories of data processed by
            <span class="highlight">IgLu's Shop</span> include both identifying
            data and special categories of personal data, as defined in Article
            9 of the GDPR.
          </p>

            philosophical beliefs, or trade union membership, as well as the

            identifying a natural person, health-related data, or data
            concerning a natural person's sex life or sexual orientation.
          </p>
          <p>
            For the processing of special categories of personal data, the
            explicit consent of the User for one or more specific purposes will
            always be required.

            their personal data for one or more specific purposes.
          </p>
          <p>
            The User will have the right to withdraw their consent at any time.
            Withdrawing consent will be as easy as giving it. As a general rule,
            withdrawing consent will not condition the use of the Website.
          </p>
          <p>
            In cases where the User must or can provide their data through forms
            to make inquiries, request information, or for reasons related to
            the content of the Website, they will be informed if completing any
            of these forms is mandatory because such information is essential
            for the proper execution of the operation carried out.

            Retention Periods for Personal Data
          </h4>
          <p>
            Personal data will only be retained for the minimum time necessary

            when that is not possible, the criteria used to determine this
            period.

            If the Data Controller intends to transfer personal data to a third

            obtained, the User will be informed about the third country or
            international organization to which it intends to transfer the data,
            as well as about the existence or absence of an adequacy decision by
            the Commission.
          </p>

          <h4 class="legal__info-subtitle">Personal Data of Minors</h4>
          <p>
            In compliance with the provisions of Articles 8 of the GDPR and 7 of
            Organic Law 3/2018, of December 5, on Personal Data Protection and
            Guarantee of Digital Rights, only individuals over the age of 14 may
            lawfully give their consent for the processing of their personal
            data by
            <span class="highlight">IgLu's Shop</span>. If the individual is
            under the age of 14, parental or guardian consent will be required
            for the processing, and it will only be considered lawful to the
            extent that they have authorized it.
          </p>
          <h4 class="legal__info-subtitle">
            Confidentiality and Security of Personal Data
          </h4>
          <p>
            <span class="highlight">IgLu's Shop</span> commits to adopting the
            necessary technical and organizational measures, according to the
            appropriate level of security for the risk associated with the data

            accidental or unlawful destruction, loss, or alteration of personal
            data transmitted, stored, or otherwise processed, as well as
            unauthorized disclosure or access to such data.
          </p>
          <p>
            The Website has an SSL (Secure Socket Layer) certificate, which
            ensures that personal data is transmitted securely and
            confidentially, as data transmission between the server and the
            User—and in feedback—is fully encrypted.
          </p>

            However, since <span class="highlight">IgLu's Shop</span> cannot
            guarantee the absolute invulnerability of the internet or the total
            absence of hackers or others who may fraudulently access personal

            undue delay when a personal data security breach occurs that is
            likely to result in a high risk to the rights and freedoms of
            natural persons. In accordance with Article 4 of the GDPR, a
            personal data security breach is understood as any security breach
            that results in accidental or unlawful destruction, loss,
            alteration, unauthorized disclosure of, or access to personal data
            transmitted, stored, or otherwise processed.
          </p>
          <p>
            Personal data will be treated as confidential by the Data
            Controller, who commits to informing and ensuring through a legal or
            contractual obligation that such confidentiality is respected by its
            employees, associates, and any person to whom it makes the
            information accessible.

            Rights Derived from the Processing of Personal Data

          <p>
            The User has the following rights regarding
            <span class="highlight">IgLu's Shop</span> and may therefore
            exercise them against the Data Controller as recognized under the
            GDPR and Organic Law 3/2018, of December 5, on Personal Data
            Protection and Guarantee of Digital Rights:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              <i>Right of access:</i> This is the User's right to obtain
              confirmation of whether
              <span class="highlight">IgLu's Shop</span> is processing their
              personal data and, if so, to obtain information about their
              specific personal data and the processing that
              <span class="highlight">IgLu's Shop</span> has carried out or is
              carrying out. This includes, among other things, information about
              the origin of such data and the recipients of any communications
              made or planned.
            </li>
            <li>
              <i>Right to rectification:</i> This is the User's right to have
              their inaccurate personal data corrected or, considering the
              purposes of the processing, completed if incomplete.
            </li>
            <li>
              <i>Right to erasure ("right to be forgotten"):</i> This is the
              User's right, provided current legislation does not establish
              otherwise, to have their personal data erased when it is no longer
              necessary for the purposes for which it was collected or
              processed; when the User withdraws their consent and there is no
              other legal basis for processing; when the User objects to
              processing and there are no other legitimate reasons to continue;
              when personal data has been unlawfully processed; when personal
              data must be erased in compliance with a legal obligation; or when
              personal data has been obtained as a result of a direct offer of
              information society services to a child under 14 years old. In
              addition to erasing the data, the Data Controller must take
              reasonable steps, considering available technology and
              implementation costs, to inform other controllers processing the
              personal data of the data subject's request for erasure of any
              links to such personal data.
            </li>
            <li>
              <i>Right to restrict processing:</i> This is the User's right to
              restrict the processing of their personal data. The User has this
              right when they contest the accuracy of their personal data; when
              processing is unlawful; when the Data Controller no longer needs
              the personal data but the User requires it for legal claims; or
              when the User has objected to processing.
            </li>
            <li>
              <i>Right to data portability:</i> If processing is carried out by
              automated means, the User has the right to receive their personal
              data from the Data Controller in a structured, commonly used, and
              machine-readable format and to transmit it to another controller.
              Where technically possible, the Data Controller will directly
              transmit the data to that other controller.
