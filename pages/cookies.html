            Accessing this Website may involve the use of cookies. Cookies are
            small amounts of information stored in the browser used by each User
            —on the different devices they may use to browse— so that the server
            remembers certain information that only the server that implemented
            them will later read. Cookies facilitate navigation, make it more
            user-friendly, and do not harm the browsing device.
          </p>
          <p>
            Cookies are automatic procedures for collecting information
            regarding the preferences determined by the User during their visit
            to the Website to recognize them as a User, personalize their
            experience and use of the Website, and may also, for example, help
            identify and resolve errors.
          </p>
          <p>
            The information collected through cookies may include the date and
            time of visits to the Website, the pages viewed, the time spent on
            the Website, and the sites visited just before and after it.
            However, no cookie allows contact with the User's phone number or
            any other personal contact method. No cookie can extract information
            from the User's hard drive or steal personal information. The only
            way private information from the User becomes part of the Cookie
            file is if the User personally provides that information to the
            server.
          </p>
          <p>
            Cookies that allow a person to be identified are considered personal
            data. Therefore, they will be subject to the Privacy Policy
            described earlier. In this sense, using them will require the User's
            consent. This consent will be communicated based on an authentic
            choice, offered through an affirmative and positive decision, before
            initial processing, removable, and documented.
